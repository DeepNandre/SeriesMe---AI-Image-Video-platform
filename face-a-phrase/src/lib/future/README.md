# üöÄ Future Feature Scaffolding

This directory contains scaffolding code for future SeriesMe features that will be implemented as the product scales and user demand grows.

## üìÅ Files Overview

### üîê `auth.ts` - User Authentication System

- OAuth integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Session management and token refresh
- Password reset workflows
- **Recommended Providers:** Auth0, Supabase Auth, or Firebase Auth

### üí≥ `payments.ts` - Subscription & Billing
**Implementation Priority:** High (Revenue Generation)
- Stripe integration for subscription billing
- Plan management (Free ‚Üí Premium ‚Üí Enterprise)
- Usage-based billing for API access
- Customer portal for billing management
- **Recommended Provider:** Stripe with React Stripe.js

### ‚òÅÔ∏è `cloud-storage.ts` - Scalable File Storage  
**Implementation Priority:** Medium (Growth Phase)
- Cloud video/image storage and CDN delivery
- Automatic video transcoding and optimization
- Thumbnail generation at custom timestamps
- Storage quota enforcement per plan
- **Recommended Providers:** Cloudinary, AWS S3 + CloudFront

### üë• `collaboration.ts` - Team Features
**Implementation Priority:** Low (Enterprise Focus)
- Team workspaces and member management
- Shared projects and collaborative editing
- Comment system with time-based video feedback
- Role-based permissions (Owner/Admin/Editor/Viewer)
- **Requirements:** Real-time sync (Socket.io, Pusher, or Supabase Realtime)

### üìä `analytics.ts` - Usage Analytics
**Implementation Priority:** Medium (Data-Driven Growth)
- User behavior tracking and funnels
- Video generation metrics and success rates
- Feature usage analytics for product decisions
- A/B testing framework integration
- **Recommended Providers:** PostHog, Mixpanel, or Amplitude

## üèóÔ∏è Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Authentication + Payments (Quarter 1)
1. Implement user authentication system
2. Add Stripe subscription billing  
3. Migrate from local storage to user accounts
4. Add plan-based feature gating

### Phase 2: Cloud Infrastructure (Quarter 2)  
1. Move video storage to cloud CDN
2. Add automatic video transcoding
3. Implement usage-based analytics
4. Scale backend infrastructure

### Phase 3: Team Features (Quarter 3)
1. Add team workspace functionality
2. Implement collaborative editing
3. Build comment/feedback system
4. Enterprise sales enablement

## üîß Implementation Notes

### Current Architecture Compatibility
- All scaffolding files are designed to work with existing feature flag system
- Services use singleton pattern consistent with current codebase
- TypeScript interfaces match existing code conventions
- React hooks provided for seamless UI integration

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Auth (Phase 1)
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-domain.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id

# Payments (Phase 1)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...

# Cloud Storage (Phase 2)  
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_secret

# Analytics (Phase 2)
POSTHOG_API_KEY=phc_...
POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com

# Collaboration (Phase 3)
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id
PUSHER_KEY=your_key
PUSHER_SECRET=your_secret
```

### Database Schema Planning
When implementing authentication and teams, consider this schema:

```sql
-- Users table
users (id, email, name, avatar, created_at, plan, subscription_id)

-- Teams table  
teams (id, name, slug, owner_id, created_at, settings)

-- Team members table
team_members (team_id, user_id, role, joined_at)

-- Projects table
projects (id, team_id, name, created_by, created_at, settings)

-- Videos table (extend existing)
videos (id, user_id, team_id?, project_id?, filename, storage_url, created_at)

-- Comments table
comments (id, video_id, user_id, content, timestamp, created_at, resolved)
```

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Review Business Requirements**: Validate feature priorities with product/business teams
2. **Technical Architecture Review**: Ensure scaffolding aligns with scaling plans  
3. **Provider Selection**: Choose specific services (Auth0 vs Supabase, Stripe setup, etc.)
4. **Implementation Planning**: Break down each phase into smaller development tasks
5. **Testing Strategy**: Plan comprehensive testing for payment flows and data migration
